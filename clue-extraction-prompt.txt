WIKIPEDIA CLUE EXTRACTION PROMPT FOR THREE CLUES GAME
=====================================================

Use this prompt with ChatGPT, Claude, or any LLM to extract interesting, 
obscure clues from Wikipedia for the Three Clues guessing game.

---

PROMPT:
-------

I need you to create three progressively revealing clues for [PERSON NAME] for a guessing game. 
Read their Wikipedia page and create clues that follow this exact pattern:

CLUE 1 (Most Obscure - Hardest to guess from):
- Should be an interesting, lesser-known fact that's surprising or unusual
- Avoid obvious details like their main profession or most famous work
- Look for: childhood details, early career, unique hobbies, surprising connections, 
  lesser-known achievements, unusual circumstances, or quirky personal facts
- Should make people think "That could be several people..."

CLUE 2 (Medium Difficulty):
- More specific but still not giving it away
- Can mention their field/profession but not their most famous work
- Look for: secondary achievements, notable works that aren't #1, relationships 
  with other famous people, significant life events, or career highlights
- Should narrow it down to maybe 2-5 possible people

CLUE 3 (Least Obscure - Easiest to guess from):
- Unmistakable identifier that makes the answer obvious
- Can include: their most famous work, iconic quotes, distinctive physical features, 
  name hints, or universally known facts
- Should make people say "Oh, of course!"

FORMAT:
Write in first person ("I...") and make each clue one clear sentence.

EXAMPLE FOR ALBERT EINSTEIN:
Clue 1: I failed my first entrance exam to a prestigious university and had to 
        attend a different school to prepare.
Clue 2: I published four groundbreaking papers in 1905, a year scientists call 
        my "miracle year."
Clue 3: My equation E=mc² is the most famous formula in physics, and I won the 
        Nobel Prize in 1921.

Now create three clues for: [PERSON NAME]
